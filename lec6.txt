Q4: Use RETAIN statement and dataset sashelp.stocks to answer the questions: 
    Create a dataset called VOLUME that has a variable VOL which is the total trading volume in each year.  
    Print the first 10 observations from VOLUME and only the following variables: YEAR, VOL. 
    What is the trading volume of IBM in 2nd quarter of 2000?
DATA STOCKS; SET SASHELP.STOCKS; 
YEAR=YEAR(DATE);
PROC SORT DATA=STOCKS; BY STOCK YEAR DATE; RUN;

DATA VOLUME; SET STOCKS; BY STOCK YEAR DATE;
IF FIRST.YEAR THEN VOL=0;
RETAIN VOL;
VOL=VOL+VOLUME;
IF LAST.YEAR THEN OUTPUT;

PROC PRINT DATA=VOLUME (OBS=10);
VAR YEAR VOL;
RUN;



Use SAS Array and DO LOOP and dataset sashelp.pricedata to answer the questions: 
    Create an array for Price1 ñ Price17. 
    Use DO LOOP to calculate a variable COUNT that is the total number of prices (Price1 ñ Price17) 
    that are higher than or equal to unit price (Price). 
    Print the first 10 observations but only these variables: DATE, COUNT. 
    What is the value of COUNT in MAR98?
DATA PRICE; SET SASHELP.PRICEDATA; 
ARRAY P(*) PRICE1-PRICE17;
COUNT=0;
DO I = 1 TO 17;
IF P(I)>=PRICE THEN COUNT=COUNT+1;
END;
RUN;

PROC PRINT DATA=PRICE (OBS=10);
VAR DATE COUNT;
RUN;
