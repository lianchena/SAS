Summary:
Please complete the following tasks using SAS, write a short report of no more than 2000 words, and submit the report and your SAS code on Moodle. Your SAS code must be correct and produce the same results as those in your report.
Dataset: EARNINGS.sas7bat
""
Part 1: Data Preparation (5 marks)p.232
From the dataset, select a sample of firms based on your student ID number. So if your student ID ends with “5”, then you select firms whose GVKEY starts with “5”. But if your student ID ends with “0”, then you use the full dataset.
Construct the variables
Winsorize the continuous variables each year at top and bottom 1%

Part 2: Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Coefficients (5 marks)
Provide and discuss descriptive statistics of the variables
Provide and discuss correlation coefficients between the variables

Part 3: Simple Models (10 marks)
Construct forecasts for one-year, two-year, and three-year ahead earnings per share using random walk model
Construct forecasts for next year’s earnings per share using moving average in the past two, three, and five years
Calculate the forecasts errors
Compare and discuss the forecast errors from different models

Part 4: Complex Models (5 marks)
Construct the forecast model using a set of accounting variables to forecast ROA(=net income in year t+1 divided by total assets in year t)
Use OLS regressions and your data to estimate the model
Discuss the results from regressions
Use stepwise regressions to select the model

Part 5: Model Back Testing (5 marks)
Partition your sample into an estimation sample and a test sample
Estimate the model using the estimation sample
Use the estimated coefficients to construct forecasts for the test sample
Calculate forecast errors
Repeat the above process for 100 times and report the descriptive statistics of the forecast errors
Discuss the forecasting ability of the models
